        <p>It's been a fun 3 weeks.  But I can't do this anymore!  I'm really just Chino.  A guy.
		MN Chino.  It was hard to resist saying "SUPREME OVERLORD" Yes, I actually can draw, code, and have a perfect GPA.  I drew all those pics.  But that doesn't mean anything.
		<br><br>Noki was a scheme I devised after reading the book: Ghost in the Wires.
		I was trying to see if I could get into my friends' server asking to get in, but instead
		become a new person and earn their trust.  It was fun, Sky, Coryn, and Shesh, but I didn't
		quite make it!
		<br><br>It's very unexpected. I have made so many friends along the way.  Stark Especially.  I'm sorry, noki doesn't exist.
		Let's be friends once I come back in May, on my actual account, count on it!
		<br><br>Now I need to get back to my eagle scout project and studying.  Once my AP test and project are done,
		I'll come back, I promise!  If you want to stay in touch till then, send me an email at supreme_overlord@mnchino.ga, and 
		I'll set you up!
		<br><br>Let's be the best we can!</p>
